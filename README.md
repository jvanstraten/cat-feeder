# Automatic cat feeder

![overengineered device](feeder.jpg)

An extremely over-engineered kibble feeder for my cat based on a "TOIVO
Automatic Pet Feeder." I would give a more accurate model number, but China;
this is what it says on the sticker. The "over-engineered" part is me adding
three loadcells to accurately keep track of feeding, a color display, and
MQTT for Home Assistant integration.

# Q&A

 - *Could I have bought something off the shelf for half the price?* Yes.
 - *Would it have had a load cell?* No. Why can none of these damn things
   measure how much they dispense? It's not hard. At least not when you
   can change the moldings to actually work with a load cell.
 - *Where's the documentation?* Yes.
 - *Cat?*
